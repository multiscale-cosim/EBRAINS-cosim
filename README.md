EBRAINS-cosim

Workflows, protocols and interfaces for the interaction of multiple simulators
supporting multiscale simulations including co-simulation as developed in the Human Brain Project

EBRAINS-cosim is based on Modular Science, a middle-ware that provides robust deployment of complex multi-application workflows on high-performance computers and local hardware. It allows for synchronization and coordination of individual components and contains dedicated and parallelized modules for data transformations between scales. Modular Science offers insight in both the system level and the individual subsystems to steer the execution, to monitor resource usage, and system health & status with small overheads on performance. Modular Science comes with a number of neuroscience co-simulation use-cases including NEST-TVB, NEST-Arbor, LFPy and neurorobotics.

This research was supported by the EBRAINS research infrastructure, funded from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the Specific Grant Agreement No. 785907 (Human Brain Project SGA2) and No. 945539 (Human Brain Project SGA3).
